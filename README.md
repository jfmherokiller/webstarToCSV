# webstarToCSV

This project is my attempt to make a program using nodejs to convert the webstar page into an ics file

so far i have been able to successfully convert and import the current printer friendly listview page from webstar

usage is main.js -f "path to printer friendly list view page with extension" the program will print out.ics to the working directory and you should be able to just import this file into google calandar.
